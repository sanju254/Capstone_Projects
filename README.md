# Capstone_Projects

Contains capstone training materias for Data Science:
In this capstone, we will take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Mask. Our job is to determine the price of each launch. We will do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for your team. We will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, we will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
